		<h3>My name is Timothy Edmondson, and I'm wanting to start a new career in the web development profession. I currently have associate degrees in accounting and business administration. I've recently quit working at an accounting agency and started my own car detailing business while I attend school. I love to exercise and be active, and I love to play sports in my free time. I'm also a big car enthusiast. I go to car shows and events with my friends all the time. I'm very outgoing and I always give 110% on everything I do.</h3>
